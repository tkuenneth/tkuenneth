## üëã Hi there. I'm Thomas, an Android dev

Being a child of the 1970s, my first encounter with programming was in the era of home computers. Those tiny machines (mine was a Laser 210) were usually fed with BASIC, the first programming language I learned. Later came C, Perl and a few more. During the 1990s I wrote a bunch of programs for the Atari ST series. The first decade of my professional career was (inevitably) Java. Today it‚Äôs mostly Kotlin.

You can find me in several places around the web (thank you very much [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) for providing the icons below ‚ù§Ô∏è)
