## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. I'm Thomas, an Android dev

Being a child of the 1970s, my first encounter with programming was in the era of home computers. Those tiny machines (mine was a Laser 210) were usually fed with BASIC, the first programming language I learned. Later came C, Perl and a few more. During the 1990s I wrote a bunch of programs for the Atari ST series. The first decade of my professional career was (inevitably) Java. Today itâ€™s mostly Kotlin.

### Writing

I love writing. You can find my articles on <a href="https://dev.to/tkuenneth">dev.to</a> and <a href="https://www.medium.com/@tkuenneth/">Medium</a>. Through the years, I have also written four books.

#### Android UI Development with Jetpack Compose

You can get the book from the publisher [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/product/android-ui-development-with-jetpack-compose/9781801812160), via Amazon, or your local book store.

#### Android 11

I also wrote a German book about Android development. The first edition was published in 2011. It has seen six editions. While it is now out of print, the latest edition is available online completely for free: https://openbook.rheinwerk-verlag.de/android11/

#### Einstieg in Eclipse / Eclipse

Back in 2007, German publisher Galileo Computing (later Rheinwerk Verlag) published the first edition of my book about the Eclipse IDE. There have been five editions. The successor was published by Hanser in 2018.

#### Java fÃ¼r Windows

My first book was published in 2006. It shows how to make Java apps that look and behave more like native Windows apps.
