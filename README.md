## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. I'm Thomas, an Android dev

Being a child of the 1970s, my first encounter with programming was in the era of home computers. Those tiny machines (mine was a Laser 210) were usually fed with BASIC, the first programming language I learned. Later came C, Perl and a few more. During the 1990s I wrote a bunch of programs for the Atari ST series. The first decade of my professional career was (inevitably) Java. Today itâ€™s mostly Kotlin.

I love writing. You can find my articles on <a href="https://dev.to/tkuenneth">dev.to</a> and <a href="https://www.medium.com/@tkuenneth/">Medium</a>.
