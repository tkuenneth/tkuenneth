## 👋 Hi there. I'm Thomas, an Android dev

Being a child of the 1970s, my first encounter with programming was in the era of home computers. Those tiny machines (mine was a Laser 210) were usually fed with BASIC, the first programming language I learned. Later came C, Perl and a few more. During the 1990s I wrote a bunch of programs for the Atari ST series. The first decade of my professional career was (inevitably) Java. Today it’s mostly Kotlin.

I maintain a bunch of open source projects. To learn more, please have a look at the pinned repositories below, or browse the [complete list](https://github.com/tkuenneth?tab=repositories). You can find me at various places on the web. Some of them are mentioned on this profile page (on the left hand side).
